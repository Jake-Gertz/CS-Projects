### This is the project specs for my tennis project!

## Goal 1: Create a program that stores and holds a db for people who have atributes of rackets, string required, tension, email, student number

## Goal 2: Create a way to add more string to the list of available strings, add a way to add players, add a way to add stringers, add a way to assign stringers to the stringing group

## Goal 3: Add a way to interact with an arduino to unlock a drawer or cabinent with a solinoid

## Goal 4: Build a gui to interact with the program that allows each method to be accessed in an easy way 

## Goal 5: Find a way to alert stringers when they have a new racket to string and a way to let players know when their racket is done being strung.

## Goal 6: Allow a check in / check out funtion (Probably needs to be done near the start of the project)

## Goal 7: Use python for the GUI, C for the main functionality, and and arduino for the functonality of the lock.

## Goal 7: Create a startup script that allows the program to be automatically loaded as well as a way to quit the program (With admin password?) and an easy way to update the program by simply dragging and dropping files into a desktop folder or with a script.

## Goal 8: Figure out how to use SQLight data base to store the information that our program is going to use.



### QOL Changes

## Add a database of string lengths from brands if you buy a full reel, mini reel, or half reel.
